	/// Stat Groups (DestinyStatGroupDefinition) has the ability to override the localized text associated with stats that are to be shown on the items with which they are associated.
	/// This defines a specific overridden stat. You could theoretically check these before rendering your stat UI, and for each stat that has an override show these displayProperties instead of those on the DestinyStatDefinition.
	/// Or you could be like us, and skip that for now because the game has yet to actually use this feature. But know that it's here, waiting for a resilliant young designer to take up the mantle and make us all look foolish by showing the wrong name for stats.
	/// Note that, if this gets used, the override will apply only to items using the overriding Stat Group. Other items will still show the default stat's name/description.
