	/// BNet attempts to group vendors into similar collections. These groups aren't technically game canonical, but they are helpful for filtering vendors or showing them organized into a clean view on a webpage or app.
	/// These definitions represent the groups we've built. Unlike in Destiny 1, a Vendors' group may change dynamically as the game state changes: thus, you will want to check DestinyVendorComponent responses to find a vendor's currently active Group (if you care).
	/// Using this will let you group your vendors in your UI in a similar manner to how we will do grouping in the Companion.
