namespace BungieNet.Destiny.Definitions.Director

	/// <summary>
	/// Represents a Map View in the director: be them overview views, destination views, or other.
	/// They have nodes which map to activities, and other various visual elements that we (or others) may or may not be able to use.
	/// Activity graphs, most importantly, have nodes which can have activities in various states of playability.
	/// Unfortunately, activity graphs are combined at runtime with Game UI-only assets such as fragments of map images, various in-game special effects, decals etc... that we don't get in these definitions.
	/// If we end up having time, we may end up trying to manually populate those here: but the last time we tried that, before the lead-up to D1, it proved to be unmaintainable as the game's content changed. So don't bet the farm on us providing that content in this definition.
