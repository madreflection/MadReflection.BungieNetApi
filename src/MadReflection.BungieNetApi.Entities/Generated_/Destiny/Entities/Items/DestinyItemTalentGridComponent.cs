	/// <summary>
	/// Well, we're here in Destiny 2, and Talent Grids are unfortunately still around.
	/// The good news is that they're pretty much only being used for certain base information on items and for Builds/Subclasses. The bad news is that they still suck. If you really want this information, grab this component.
	/// An important note is that talent grids are defined as such:
	/// A Grid has 1:M Nodes, which has 1:M Steps.
	/// Any given node can only have a single step active at one time, which represents the actual visual contents and effects of the Node (for instance, if you see a "Super Cool Bonus" node, the actual icon and text for the node is coming from the current Step of that node).
	/// Nodes can be grouped into exclusivity sets *and* as of D2, exclusivity groups (which are collections of exclusivity sets that affect each other).
	/// See DestinyTalentGridDefinition for more information. Brace yourself, the water's cold out there in the deep end.
